## Asides

Asides provide an easy way to represent content that is only indirectly related to the article's main content. Where supported, MyST will attempt to display an `aside` _as close as possible_ but separately from the main article, such as in the side-margin. 

````{myst}
The main article contains main-article text!

```{aside}
This is an aside. It is not entirely relevant to the main article.
```
````
